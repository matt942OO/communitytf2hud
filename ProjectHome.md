### The Health and Ammo ###
![http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3702088/hudammo2.png](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3702088/hudammo2.png)
  * The health and ammo for cl\_hud\_minmode 1 is Flame's while the health and ammo for cl\_hud\_minmode 0 is povohat's.
  * Flame's information is raised and centered a little bit more sacrificing size for visibility, while povohat's is large and lower sacrificing location for size.
  * type "bindtoggle j cl\_hud\_minmode" in console to switch between them just to see which one works best for you.

### The Ubercharge Meters ###
![http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3702088/ubercharge.png](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3702088/ubercharge.png)
  * The minmode 1 ubercharge meter resembles one originally used by Buick. It only shows the % number and takes the place of the health making it higher up and more in the center
  * The minmode 0 meter is povohat's. It is larger but lower on the screen.

### Weapon Charge Meters ###
![http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3702088/demometer.png](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3702088/demometer.png)
  * The minmode 1 meters are typically directly below or above the ammo of the weapon charging
  * The minmode 0 meters are much larger, have tick marks to give you a bit more accuracy on your charges and have different colors for different classes.

### The Target IDs ###
![http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3702088/targetid.png](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3702088/targetid.png)
  * The Target IDs have been lowered to get them out of the way of your crosshair.
  * There is a numerical health value on them to see just how much health the person you are looking at has or how much health the person you are healing has.
  * The initial idea of two-colored Target IDs was m0re's which later was edited by Flame.

### The Quickswitch Menu ###
![http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3702088/quickswitch.png](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3702088/quickswitch.png)
  * This was taken from an idea by ChiefSpecialK. The placement of the quickswitch menu is now on the right side of the screen
  * Flame took the positioning and redid the size of the elements to make it much more compact and easy on the eyes.

### The Team and Class Menus ###
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3702088/TeamMenu.PNG ![http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3702088/classmenu.png](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3702088/classmenu.png)
  * The team menu was taken from Revan\_xp's HUD. It is much more minimalistic while still giving necessary data. Flame recoded it so the shortcut keys worked and it was centered on every res
  * The Class menus are from Seeker's HUD. The only modifications made were the fonts as well the alignments.

### The Gamemode HUDs ###
![http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3702088/ctf.png](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3702088/ctf.png)
  * The CTF HUD was made more compact with less coloring so everything would fit nicely.
  * The control point icons are always in min 0 mode. to fix this delete controlpointicon.res from your tf/resource/ui folder.
  * The PL and PLR HUDs are also resized to prevent overlaps with your ammo and health and are smaller than usual. Every HUD was done by Flame.

### The Scoreboard ###
![http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3702088/scoreboard.png](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3702088/scoreboard.png)
  * The scoreboard started off as m0res, then Flame edited it with more color and information, and now it is Flame's scoreboard with a Kill/Death section used by Revan\_xp
  * The scoreboard by default is 6v6 aimed. If you want to remove it, open your tf/resource/ui folder and delete scoreboard.res. This will revert your scoreboard back to the Valve standard.

### Other Stuff ###
  * The engineer metal icon in min 1 was originally noid's idea, in min 0, povo place it near the ammo
  * The BEAT BLU'S TIME on gravelpit popup is gone for good as are the boxes that tell you to cap the control points on cp maps and grab the intel on ctf maps.
  * The spectator HUD is vertical down the sides not horizontal anymore
  * There are 7 kill notifications in the top. the spacing was taken from one of m0re's HUDs.
  * The freezecam now tells you how much health your killer had and the box is moved to the bottom right corner for better screenshot possibilities.
  * All of the clocks use the min 1 values. I would not change this as it will cause overlaps and other random bugs.
  * The popups saying you got more dominations that round than your previous best (or in my case revenges) is gone. the file is stat\_summary\_base in resource/ui if you want it back for whatever reason.
